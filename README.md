# Shuhari

**Shuhari** is a Japanese concept that describes the stages of mastery:

- **Shu (守)**: Follow the rules and learn the fundamentals.
- **Ha (破)**: Break with tradition and adapt what you’ve learned.
- **Ri (離)**: Transcend the rules and create your own approach.

This repository is the foundation for a mentorship platform built on that philosophy.  
It guides learners from structured fundamentals to adaptive expertise, with rigorous evaluation and human review at every critical checkpoint.

**Core principles**
- Structured progression from beginner to mastery
- Evidence-based learning (hands-on tasks, deliverables, and reviews)
- Human-in-the-loop accountability
- No shortcuts, only proven capability
